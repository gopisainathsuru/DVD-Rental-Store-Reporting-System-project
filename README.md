# DVD Rental store reporting system project
* For database storage we will use MySQL.
* Project Description:
Our project centers on enhancing a DVD rental store's operations by enabling the owner to independently generate essential business reports. The owner employs software to manage the store, while a part-time tech-savvy assistant usually creates reports using SQL queries. In the assistant's absence, our project ensures the owner's access to valuable insights by simplifying report generation and offering user-friendly tools. This empowers informed decision-making, efficient inventory management, and improved customer service.
